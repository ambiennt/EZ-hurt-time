# EZ-hurt-time
A simple mod to change the 10 tick hit cooldown when attacking entities in BDS + EZ

This mod aims to be an ElementZero implementation of the hurt time mod from PlatinumBDS, by Imrglop. https://github.com/Imrglop/PlatinumBDS

You can configure the hurt time in the custom.yaml file. This mod uses offsets and I only tested in 1.16.20, I dont know if 1.16.40 has different offsets.
